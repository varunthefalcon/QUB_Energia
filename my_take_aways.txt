My thoughts on this analython 1:

1. you were playing in the wrong field - should have been more inference/report and less coding/attempting modals
2. should have asked others instead of relying just on the internet reports
3. should over come hesitation/dilemmma and wrote more content then filtered. Cant perfect every line
4. should have  included references, graph and table labels and wrote more about them
5. should learn more about statistical testing
6. should redo this assignment by this week for my improvement no matter the result
